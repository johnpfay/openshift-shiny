We followed ORNL's instructions for processing in ArcGIS, loading the LandScan grid first and maintaining WGS84 projection parameters. Using Spatial Analyst, we ran the Zonal Statistics as Table function to sum estimated daytime population for each LandScan raster cell to obtain an estimated daytime population for each SVI 2018 census tract. ",Tracts having no LandScan cells that overlay have been assigned null values (i.e. -999).,
